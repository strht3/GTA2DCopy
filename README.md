## Instructions for editing
file "assets" includes every assets in games.

Go inside a file "js" to see all codes. 
main.js includes a base structure of entire game.
load.js loads every single assets and files into game
start.js is a for start page codes.
shop.js, inventory.js, Settings.js is for each pages that are possible in game.

Go inside file"assets", go to "data", and you will see a map data.

If you want to edit, first make sure to read throgh main.js simply.(not deep! take it easy) 
image loading is easier if you put all images into assets/image folder, since you can just copy loading codes in load.js. This is same in audios too.

index.html is a html code of entire web page! do not touch this that much or else it might change entire game.

As you might know, javascript codes are really long. But if you read throgh it, it is easier than you think. Take it easy!
